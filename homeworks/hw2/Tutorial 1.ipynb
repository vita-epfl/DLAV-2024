PyTorch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Neural Networks\n","\n","Deep Learning is based on artificial neural networks which have been around in some form since the late 1950s. The networks are built from individual parts approximating neurons, typically called units or simply \"neurons.\" Each unit has some number of weighted inputs. These weighted inputs are summed together (a linear combination) then passed through an activation function to get the unit's output.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ckyuKqRWay-M16NDASAOPlpR9KOn74-i\" width=400px>\n","\n","Mathematically this looks like: \n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","y &= f(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b) \\\\\n","y &= f\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i \\right)\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","With vectors this is the dot/inner product of two vectors:\n","\n","$$\n","h = \\begin{bmatrix}\n","x_1 \\, x_2 \\cdots  x_n\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","\\cdot \n","\\begin{bmatrix}\n","           w_1 \\\\\n","           w_2 \\\\\n","           \\vdots \\\\\n","           w_n\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BojGSowt5MUF"},"source":["### Stack them up!\n","\n","We can assemble these unit neurons into layers and stacks, into a network of neurons.

the MNIST images.

The network itself is a class inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`. You define each of the operations separately, like `nn.Linear(784, 128)` for a fully connected linear layer with 784 inputs and 128 units.\n","\n","The class needs to include a `forward` method that implements the forward pass through the network. In this method, you pass some input tensor `x` through each of the operations you defined earlier. The `torch.nn` module also has functional equivalents for things like ReLUs in `torch.nn.functional`. This module is usually imported as `F`. Then to use a ReLU activation on some layer (which is just a tensor), you'd do `F.relu(x)`. Below are a few different commonly used activation functions.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KbSbYz-5ocIOEyM7y2dTsWozMi_XEo8S\" width=700px>\n","\n","So, for this network, I'll build it with three fully connected layers, then a softmax output for predicting classes.
